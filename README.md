# 3DSomaMS
3DSomaMS is an R package for soma reparation, segmentation and characterization.

## Description
The 3DSomaMS component is designed to characterise quantitatively a 3D soma, according to morphological features taken from its image reconstruction, to build a mathematical model that also will allow simulation of artificial somas.

## Functionality
Selection of soma 3D representation generate table with quantitative characterisation reconstruction of the soma.
